                <p>The main purpose of this site is to blank again what I have learned as an undergrad with my studies in Computer Science. I have been a long term ‘seeker of knowledge'. When I first started my undergrad studies, I was living in Seattle, WA and while I started my college career I went with aspirations of studying physics and astronomy. </p>
                <p>Those goals were put on hold when I began to experience some terrifying medical issues. I was eventually hospitalized and was not able to go to school or study for over 3 months. My GPA for the quarter also took a blow but that seemed of little importance as I was certain I was not going to live very long. Some people handle challenges differently and with a family history that has experienced medical problems, I thought surely my life would be cut short. </p>
                <p>Fortunately for me, after months of tests and procedures it was determined that I had somehow developed Ulcerative Colitis. I’m unsure of the cause but I have my theories. </p>
                <p> During my “time off” from work and school. I stumbled across Bitcoin, early 2017, and investigated some of the technology behind it such as blockchain technology, Proof of Work, and the meaning behind it. Without getting into the political nature and reasonings behind its creation by the alias Satoshi Nakamoto which could be one or many, while they do contain a PGP key that would be able to prove the identity of him or them, this has been used to expose individuals claiming to be the creator. </p>
                <p> How does this lead me to Computer Science? </p>
                <p> My interest in physics and astronomy was spawned from my want to know everything. I had to let go to these educational goals due to the realistic nature of turning college education into a career. It is very competitive and where you go to school matters. A lot. I also would not be in any state to return to school and work full time, unless I could finish a degree online. I found the right school and the more I was learning about blockchain technology, my interest in computer science began to grow immensely. Now I want to know how everything in computer science works, hardware engineering, The Internet of Things, just, everything. </p>
                <p> So, while I am perusing my degree I am also staying active in learning in my own studies and practices with simple to moderately advanced Arduino projects involving C++, soldering parts and learning 3D printing. </p>
